We will build and configure plateform based on latest technology in java, which will help us to maintain and use aviailable features of framework.
 
	- Will include Spring Boot(to configure spring features) ,Hibernate/JPA(as ORM(Object Relational Mapping) tool), 
	  Maven(to build the project), Many Spring modules like Ioc(Container -for dependency injection), core, context, beans etc...(to simply our development). 
	- Create all business entity(around 18 to 20, based on our discussion) in java as POJO.
  - Define and configure relationship between these entities using ORM(Hibernate/JPA).
	
	As a result: 
				 It will automatically create all tables in our database.
	       We can directly use these object(POJO) in out java code to communicate to our tables. 
				 No need to manully create and maintain these table, as above ORM tool will do this for us.
